## Abstract
While some studies have analyzed and extracted the aesthetic factors of infographics and applied them through designated statistics, challenges remain in the automatic generation of infographics from visualization collections directly through data exploration systems. We recognize seven challenges in creating human-centric presentations, and propose VisCollage to organize and present data events by reducing verbosity and enhancing hierarchies, as well as designing annotative collages, which we define as an instance of anatomical infographic. VisCollage is built based on four design principles, including chart combination, structured guidance, detail-on-demand, and consistency-and-captions, auto-generating a novel presentations called “visual collage”. We assess readers’ appreciation of the results of VisCollage compared to another narrative visualization layout, data comics, and evaluate the satisfaction of design algorithms from creators’ perspectives; in addition, we further conducted an experiment from explorer’s perspectives during the process of data exploration to the presentation of data events. Our results verify that VisCollage improves the understanding and narrative from data exploration to data presentation, and it takes the first step in automating the reproduction of expressive data events.
